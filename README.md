## Telecom churn project 
Missing Value Handling:
The code now explicitly checks for missing values and handles them by imputing with the median for numerical columns. This is a robust approach.
High-Value Customer Filtering:
The 70th percentile calculation and high-value customer filtering are performed correctly.
Churn Tagging:
The churn tagging logic is accurate and aligned with the problem definition.
EDA:
Added more relevant EDA plots (boxplot) to visualize the relationship between key features and churn.
Added visualization for important features, and ROC curve, and confusion matrix.
